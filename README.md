# Getting Started with Premier League React App

React app for the English premier league table given JSON of fixtures and results with option to see fixtures and results by club, home and away

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app loads the Premier League table using the data from the data service and on clicking any team, their fixtures load in a drawer

I used `ts-ignore` to prevent some typescript errors and use `any` typing everywhere to save time

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
